Hi there! I'm Kanazawa Hiroto, and this is my portfolio website code built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a touch of JavaScript. Let's dive into the features:

> But, wait! Have any cool project ideas to share or need some work done? Just shoot me an email at walterseric1015@gmail.com. Let's chat over a virtual coffee! 😊 And if you're wondering why you should consider working together, check out projects like **PfpFinder** (https://pfpfinder.com) (where you can find the best pfps - almost 50k+!), **Alt Text Generator** (https://alttext.tech/) (just upload an image to see what it is!).Check out my complete profile here: https://github.com/Walters-Eric

## **Why This Web Developer Portfolio Stands Out**

* **User Experience Focus:**  The dual theme and speed optimizations show I care about delivering a great experience.
* **Attention to Detail:** Thoughtful font selections and animations add a polished touch. 
* **Real Projects:**  This isn't just about tech skills, it's about what I can build!
